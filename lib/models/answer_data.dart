/*
* So essentially, a few things need to happen in the process here when bringing in data
* from the Answers subcollection within a given Patient's document.
*
* First, it needs to do a query for Answers and only pull back the Documents within Answers that
* fall within the Date range determined by the query (Default will be last 7 Days but we will have options
* within there for others.
*
* Secondly, once we've grabbed the requsite Answers docs from the Collection, we'll
* turn each Document that we've grabbed from Answers into a Questionnaire (gets us
* using that class again anyways).
*
* Then for each question within our Questionnaire object, we'll need to check if it
* already has a corresponding _AnswerData object (would be good to have a list for these),
* and if not create one.
*
* In any case, we will need to increment the corresponding answer based on how it was answered in the questionnaire
*
* With that info, we should be able to make a simple List of our _AnswerData class and have that be usable for these
* infographics.
