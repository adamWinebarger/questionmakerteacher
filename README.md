# questionmakerteacher

This will be the teacher version of the questionmaker application that we're currently working on. While it will be using a lot from the questionmaker prototype, the fact that this will inevitably be split into parent and teacher apps, and the fact that components of the prototype will be getting used piecemeal made it seem like a good call to make a new repo now.

## Things to still do

- finish setting up firebase dependencies: particularly the login/googleID
- Add firebase functionality to the necessary screens
- Finish building the questionnaire screen
- Build the portion of the app that sends data back to the cloud firestore 
database
- ... something else but I forget what

## Known Issues/Problems

- Patient List is now not updating after returning from AddPatientScreen. Will need to address that in testing.
