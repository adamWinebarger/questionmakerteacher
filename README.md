# questionmakerteacher

This will be the teacher version of the questionmaker application that we're currently working on. While it will be using a lot from the questionmaker prototype, the fact that this will inevitably be split into parent and teacher apps, and the fact that components of the prototype will be getting used piecemeal made it seem like a good call to make a new repo now.

## Things to still do

- add firebase dependencies
- Setup screens for the other parts of the app
- ... alot, really
